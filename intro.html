                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Greetings! I am Anjali, a dedicated and passionate IT student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree
                    in Information Technology at the Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW). In
                    this journey of knowledge and innovation, I have been exploring the dynamic realms of technology
                    with a fervor for learning and growth.

                    As a student of IT, I have delved into various facets of the field, gaining insights into
                    programming, software development, and the ever-evolving landscape of information technology. My
                    academic pursuits at IGDTUW have not only equipped me with technical skills but have also nurtured a
                    mindset that thrives on creativity and problem-solving.

                    This portfolio serves as a testament to my journey, showcasing the projects, skills, and experiences
                    that have shaped my academic and professional endeavors. Join me as I navigate through the
                    fascinating world of IT, driven by curiosity, determination, and the pursuit of excellence.
                </p>
